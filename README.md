**Discord generator bot**

**Disclaimer: if you are looking for an actual discord account generator, keep looking, this is not it. This is a Legitamate discord bot that uses commands to give accounts to server members.**

**Disclaimer 2: I do not condone illegal activity and will not take responsability for what you use this bot for.**

This bot is short python code that will take accounts you put in the .txt files and give them to a member that used it.

The bot's syntax is !gen
To generate an account the user has to do !gen {what they want to generate} (example: !gen spotify)

To add the accounts make 3 .txt files named "spotify.txt", "roblox.txt" and "valorant.txt".
To make the bot work put the token in client.run("token")

If you want to add custom accounts look into the code, i'm not gonna help you with that. 
I expect you to have atleast a bit python knowledge.

There should be a Replit link somewhere.
Also the accounts should be line-to-line, like this:
Account1:password1            
Account2:passsword2

Happy botting, VisualVenture#4208

Also give credits if you are gonna use this bot as i put alot of work in it.
